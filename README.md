# Flood Maps – Automated DEM-Based Terrain Analysis and Check-Dam Site Extraction

This repository contains the complete project folder for an automation pipeline developed as part of a Bachelor’s thesis focused on **flood-related terrain analysis using Digital Elevation Models (DEM)**.
The project demonstrates how hydrological preprocessing and terrain-derived features can be automated and then be exposed through a backend API.

---

### `/docker/`

Contains all Docker-related configuration required to run the project in a reproducible environment.

* **Dockerfile** – Builds a GDAL-enabled Python environment suitable for geospatial processing
* **docker-compose.yml** – Defines service configuration for running the backend
* **init.sh** – Initialization script used to prepare the runtime environment inside the container

This setup ensures consistent execution across different systems.

---

### `/backend/`

Implements the **FastAPI backend** that exposes the automated terrain analysis pipeline as a REST API.

Key responsibilities:

* Accepting user input parameters (area of interest, processing options)
* Downloading DEM data programmatically
* Executing hydrological preprocessing and analysis steps
* Returning derived geospatial outputs

> **Note:** This module requires a GDAL-enabled Python environment. Which can be created using the Dockerfile provided.

---

### `/examples/`

Contains example GIS outputs generated during the thesis work for the **Aluva, Kerala** study area.

* **`q_layers/`** – Outputs generated through *manual analysis* using QGIS
* **`p_layers/`** – Outputs generated by the *automated processing pipeline*

These layers are included to facilitate **qualitative and visual comparison** between traditional and automated approaches.

---

### `/notebooks/`

Contains a Jupyter Notebook used for:

* Step-by-step explanation of the automation pipeline
* Demonstration of terrain and hydrological processing logic
* Supporting transparency and reproducibility of the research methodology

This notebook is intended primarily for **academic review and understanding**, rather than production use.

> **Note:** An API Key from open topography is requried to run this pipeline. The KEY must be used in the download-dem section.

---

### `README.md`

This file. Provides a high-level overview of the project, repository structure, and usage information.

## Reproducibility

The project prioritizes reproducibility through:

* Docker-based environment configuration
* Explicit dependency declaration
* Inclusion of example datasets and outputs
* Clear separation of manual vs automated results

> **Note:** An API Key from open topography is requried to utilize this project.
